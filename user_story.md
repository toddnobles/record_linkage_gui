- Joe is a grad student who is working on digitizing and transcribing scanned historical forms. They are not very technical and used a very bad OCR technology so need to be able to view and edit the text extracted from a lot of images very quickly. 

- Sammy is a professor who has already used some computer vision models so their text was read in quite cleanly. They want the ability to review lots of fields at once since they won't have to make very many edits. 

- Bob is a research assistant with no experience coding. They've been asked by a professor to check that a set of information was extracted from the images correctly. They value an interface that they don't need to work with filepaths or any code.

Brittany is a hospital administrator. Brittany wants to check that digitized paper records were done [that's not the right word] correctly because the hospital is only uses the cheapest technology. Brittany wants an easy to use interface that lets her move quickly between documents. Brittany's job involves basic computer technical skills. She's mostly familiar with Microsoft Office is not happy about having to digitize all of these records. 

Tess is an overwhelmed first year PhD student working on her professor's research project. Tess wants to check the accuracy of digitzed records so that she can start the preliminary data analysis. Tess wants an interface that is easy to learn because she's on a time crunch and something she can start and stop easily because she gets interrupted often. She has some experience with digitized documents and R but has never used python.
