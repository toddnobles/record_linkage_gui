Brittany is a hospital administrator. Brittany wants to check that digitized paper records were done [that's not the right word] correctly because the hospital is only uses the cheapest technology. Brittany wants an easy to use interface that lets her move quickly between documents. Brittany's job involves basic computer technical skills. She's mostly familiar with Microsoft Office is not happy about having to digitize all of these records. 

Tess is an overwhelmed first year PhD student working on her professor's research project. Tess wants to check the accuracy of digitzed records so that she can start the preliminary data analysis. Tess wants an interface that is easy to learn because she's on a time crunch and something she can start and stop easily because she gets interrupted often. She has some experience with digitized documents and R but has never used python.
