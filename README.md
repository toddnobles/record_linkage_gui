## Resources


### Potential datasets
- https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/8-36

- https://www.pseudopeople.org/


### Example R 
[Loom recording](https://www.loom.com/share/30cd84444341433492a7a40150a41824?sid=310023e0-429f-4c50-a3c5-49c512780c94). This shows an earlier version of the OCR hand checking GUI. 

### Record Linkage
- https://github.com/OlivierBinette/Awesome-Entity-Resolution?tab=readme-ov-file 
- It doesn't really matter which algorithm we use. Splink is the best option in Python at the moment. 

## Tentative project plan for discussion
- Hand correction gui. Data will be archive forms that Todd has copies of. 
- GUI for comparing potential matches and selecting best match by the user.
