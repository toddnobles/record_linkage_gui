## Project Description
The only tool currently in this toolkit is intended for users working to digitize documents using OCR or computer vision models and who need a way to compare the extracted text to the original images. Additionally, it allows users to make edits to the extracted data as they're reviewing and save these edits to a cleaned version of their data set. 

Future tools will assist users who are trying to link records between datasets and need a way to speed up and reduce the errors in the process of performing hand matches or adjudicating between potential matches.
